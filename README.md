# hcl booking api
High Level Brief :

The Meeting Room Availability Problem is solved in 2 parts

1. Backend is implemented in Spring Boot

The App is Deployed in EC2 Instance and the Swagger UI exposes the End Points and Model Objects

1. The UI is Done in Angulat 8 with Routing / Ng Boot Strap

This App is deployed in Amazon EC2 and for Demo I have enabled CORS
